local x = 10 -- When you see this on the [DEBUG] line, enter s one more time to execute the line.
local y = x + 5 -- When you see this on the [DEBUG] line, x has been defined. Run "print x" to see the value of x.
local z = y * 2
print("y =", y) -- When you see this on the [DEBUG] line, enter s one more to execute the line. It will print on the left side of the console, where program output goes.
